autoradiographic study on the origin and fate of small lymphoid cells in
the dog bone marrow.. effect of femoral artery clamping during in vivo  
availability of h3-thymidine .                                          
  the origin and fate of small lymphoid cells in the dog bone marrow    
were studied autoradiographically by observing the effect of clamping of
the femoral artery during in vivo availability of h3-thymidine . heavily
labeled small lymphoid cells appeared in the bone marrow of the clamped 
leg 3 hours after injection of the tracer and increased in number up to 
6 days . the labeling indices of these cells, however, were             
significantly lower than those of control marrow . a possible           
interpretation is that dog bone marrow contains two populations of small
lympho id cells, one migrating into the marrow via the blood stream, the
other originating from local precursor cells within the marrow . there  
was no evidence for a transformation of migrated small lymphoid cells   
into erythroblasts during the first 48 hours after injection of         
h3-thymidine .

3820. the dubious haemopoietic
stem cell function of the lym-
phoid cells of the blood.
autoradiographic studies on
dogs
the migration, fate and turnover of
lymphoid cells in blood and bone marrow of
irradiated and non-irradiated dogs were
studied by serial autoradiography with co-
ping of the hind legs during the plasma
clearance time of h3-thymidine injected into
an anterior vein.  in irradiated dogs,
the h3-thymidine injection procedure was car-
ried out during the early recovery phase
following 250 r whole body x-irradiation.
conclusive evidence of transformation of
hematogenous bone marrow lymphoid cells
into hemopoietic precursors was not found.
however, in the light of the individual
grain counts transformation of a few lymphoid
cells into hemopoietic cells cannot be
ruled out.  the data obtained from a dog in the
very early recovery phase following
whole body irradiation strongly indicate such
a transformation.

4311. studies on intravenous transfusion
of thymus cells and
lymphnode cells.  iii. influence of
transfused thymus cells
and lymphnode cells on the bone
marrow
in rabbits transfused with thymus cells and
lymphnode cells the peripheral blood and
bone marrow were studied.  the transfusion
of thymus cells caused a peripheral
lymphocytosis and a diminution of lymphoid
cells in the bone marrow of both young
and adult rabbits.  the transfusion of lymphnode
cells resulted in a peripheral lympho-
penia, and an initial increase and a subsequent
diminution of lymphoid cells in the
bone marrow.  it is suggested that lymphoid cells
in the bone marrow may be lympho-
cytes which are stored or discharged according
to a variety of conditions.  further-
more, thymus cells are thought to mobilize
lymphocytes from the bone marrow to
the peripheral blood.

172. autoradiographic
studies of lymphoid
cells in blood and
bone marrow of nor-
mal and irradiated
dogs
the migration, fate, and
turnover of lymphoid
cells in blood and bone marrow
of 4 irradiated and 4 non-
irradiated dogs were studied
by serial autoradiography
with clamping of the hind legs
during the plasma clear-
ance time of h3-thymidine
injected into an anterior
vein.  in irradiated dogs, the
h3-thymidine injection pro-
cedure was carried out during
the early recovery phase
after 250 r of whole-body
x-irradiation.  the results on
2 irradiated and 2 normal
dogs were described in de-
tail.  migration of lymphoid
cells from blood to marrow
parenchyma was confirmed
in the irradiated dogs.  con-
clusive evidence of transformation
of these cells into
hemopoietic precursors was not
found.  the relative
number of large lymphoid cells,
the labeling index of
the whole population of lymphoid
cells, and that of small
lymphoid cells were increased
in irradiated marrow;
few initially labeled small
lymphoid cells could also be
observed.  these data indicate
that the pattern of pro-
liferation of lymphoid cells is
changed in irradiated re-
generating bone marrow.

1066. the effect of lymphoid cells from 
the lymph of specifically immunised sheep
on the growth of primary sarcomata in
rats
the growth of primary fibrosarcomata induced in
rats with 3:4-benzpyrene was retarded by the injection
of lymphocytes obtained from the efferent duct of a
lymph node in a sheep immunized with a piece of the
tumor to be treated.  the action of the heterologous lym-
phocytes was specific to the particular tumor used for
immunization suggesting that reaction against tumor-
specific antigens is involved.  the cells responsible are
believed to be medium-sized pyroninophilic lymphocytes
which may stimulate the immune system of the host to
react against the autochthonous tumor.
